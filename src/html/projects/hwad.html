          <p>Being able to connect to potential clients quickly and effectively is a problem many business have today.  Though my work with Hawaii Water and Drainage I was able to help fix this problem.  Utilizing my web design and webmaster skills I was able to put up a clean website that allowed HWAD to display their work to potential clients.</p>

          <p>Before meeting, HWAD really needed to find a way to market and showcase their projects to the digital consumer.  Their great work needed a great site to show their potential clients the quality and expertise they provide.  I was able to address this problem by making a site that properly describes the quality of their products and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took the approach of designing responsively, providing users on any device a wonderful visual experience.  This allowed HWAD the opportunity to communicate with clients on multiple platforms anywhere from a smartphone to a 27‚Äù display.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, a lot of business is happening online and companies need a stronger digital presence.  After working alongside HWAD, I was able to lay the foundation and help construct a great digital presence for their company.
