          <p>In the spring of my junior year and after a few meetings with Kamehameha Schools’ administration, I planned, pitched and received funding for a networking trip to San Francisco. After returning from <a href="/projects/Nalukai2016.html">Nalukai Academy</a>, I felt an immense urge to travel to the Bay Area to experience the zeitgeist, fast-paced nuances, and unbridled speed of business present in the tech capital of the world. Meeting with venture capitalists, developers, and founders, I along with my mom, Pakalani Bello from Kamehameha Schools’, and Ken Chong from ReVisualEyeZ media toured the headquarters of some of the world’s most famous technology companies. Leveraging my professional network at home and my growing network in the Bay, I met with venture capitalists, developers, and project managers at companies like Google, eBay, LinkedIn, and Dropbox. I was able to tap into the growing community of Kamehameha alumni in the Bay, and it was in these meetings where I realized I was pursuing a career path that I could one-day make into a reality. The week-long expedition filled with tours, college-visits, and meetings solidified my love for the area, and opened many doors for further opportunity.</p>
          

          <p>In collaboration with Kamehameha Schools and ReVisualEyeZ media, this video was made to document my journey:</p>

            Nalukai was truly an amazing experience for me.  There, I was able to find people as driven and invested in their field as I am.  Nalukai was the first environment that I was given the opportunity to collaborate with these types of kids who have put in so much time like I have to master their craft, whether it’d be photography, videography, design, or programming.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s an excerpt from a writing piece I did at the camp:</p>
          <p>Fifty lines deep in code I had a realization. Frantically bashing on my keyboard, I paused to take a look around. What I saw truly reassured me that I found my element, and that I’m truly where I’m supposed to be. My friends, despite only physically meeting them fourty-eight hours ago, were all having professional conversations about things that they all are passionate and brilliant at. Looking left, the photographers were deep in a conversation about how a certain ISO would affect the composition of an image. To my right, others were “wired in” on all of the design and digital media work we were given that day. Across the room, some collaborated on microwave designs, while others were deep into a prototyping process. A grin shot across my face and for the first time, I felt like the pieces were fitting together.
